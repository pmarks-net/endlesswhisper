## I'm never gonna pop again.

**Endless Whisper** is a Chrome extension that continuously plays a very quiet sound, in order to keep your sound card awake.

I made this in order to fix a very obscure bug that occurs when my Chromebook is connected to an external monitor with analog audio out.  When I visit a website with audio, I hear a loud pop as the sound turns on, followed by another softer pop several seconds after the audio stops.

With this extension running in the background, I no longer hear the pops.  This may increase power consumption, so you can click the extension's icon to enable or disable it.
